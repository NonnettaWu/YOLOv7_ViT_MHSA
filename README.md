## YOLOv7_ViT_MHSA_Darknet

The Repository changes the BackBone `ELAN_Darknet` of YOLOv7 by adding `self-attention method` on the last BackBone layer.

I refered the codes of `ViT (Vision Transformer)` and remove the MLP layer.

Original code from rwightman and WZMIAOMIAO, below Urls are their Repositories.
